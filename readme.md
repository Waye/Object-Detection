## Implementation Guidelines

1. **First Phase**: Implement and test YOLOv5-s, YOLOv8-s, Faster R-CNN and RT-DETR to establish baselines across architectural types
2. **Second Phase**: Add remaining models to complete the evaluation suite
3. **Focus Metrics**: Pay special attention to mAP50 and per-class performance on smaller objects (Persons, Traffic signs)
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Create direct comparisons between:
   - YOLO generations (v5 → v8 → v11)
   - One-stage vs. two-stage (YOLO vs. Faster R-CNN)
   - CNN vs. transformer approaches (All YOLO vs. RT-DETR/DETA)
   - Efficiency vs. accuracy (Plot mAP against FPS/Parameters)
